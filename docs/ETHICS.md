# AI-Ethica Ethics Framework

## Governance Principles

AI-Ethica follows the **IEEE 7000-2021** standard for ethical system design, which provides a framework for addressing ethical concerns throughout the system lifecycle.

## Core Ethical Principles

1. **Fairness**: Ensure equitable treatment across all protected groups
2. **Transparency**: Provide clear explanations of model decisions and limitations
3. **Accountability**: Maintain audit trails and responsibility for AI system outcomes
4. **Privacy**: Protect individual privacy and data rights
5. **Non-maleficence**: Prevent harm through bias, discrimination, or misuse

## Implementation

Our framework implements these principles through:

- **Bias Detection**: Identify and measure unfair treatment
- **Fairness Metrics**: Quantify equity across demographic groups
- **Transparency Tools**: Assess and improve model explainability
- **Privacy Evaluation**: Evaluate data protection measures
- **Accountability Tracking**: Maintain decision logs and incident reports

## Contributing Ethically
